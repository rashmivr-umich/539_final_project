                    <h3>Early mornings</h3>
                    <p>She begins her day by rolling around in her soft bed of leaves up in the tree till the glow of the morning sun tickles her heavy eyelids to pry them open. Once awake, she begins with a tour of the vast University of Michigan Campus to see if everything is in place. The last stop is her nut stash, where she checks her inventory to see if her cheeky neighbors have stolen any.</p>

                    <p>She begins her day with a hearty and nutty breakfast, full of vitamins and proteins.  Never work on a hungry stomach is something she truly believes in. This is when she realizes that she is late to her photoshoot.</p>

                    <p>Being a celebrity, her major part of the day is spent in photoshoots sporting a blue and maize colored UMSI tee. She poses with VR headsets, UMSI laptops, in lab environments to promote the cutting-edge work done here at UMSI. You can always find her on the social media pages.</p>

                    <p>Resting is an important part of life, Mumsi loves sleeping. She takes a short nap during the day of three hours to feel fresh the rest of her day. Her favorite napping spots are delicate branches of the majestic trees in the law quadrangle, UMich building ledges and the top of the clock tower (it has a breathtaking view).</p>

                    <h3>Nuts!</h3>
                    <p>Winter always comes and she must be prepared for the unforgiving season in Michigan. Before the sky has an opportunity to lay a thick blanket of snow over the grass, she heads out to collect priceless nuts for the coming winter. Nut gathering takes up most of her day. Sniffing about, she gathers nuts and caches them in scattered places so that other squirrels do not steal them. To deceive the other squirrel who’s watching, she digs an empty hole, pretends to throw in some acorns and covers up the hole. She chases scurrying beetles and insects to have a fulfilling meal.</p>
